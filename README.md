# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

# Sprint 2: Advanced HTML and CSS: Stage 4.

This project stage consists of two parts.
First, we had to do some refactoring. Rearranging our existing code to use a flat BEM file structure.
Second, we finished our coffee landing page by adding three new sections.

## Project features

The functionalities we used:

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A couple of ways we could improve the website. First we could include either a button to allow the user to return to the top or by having the nav bar follow the user as they scroll through the page allowing them to click navigating to any portion of the page in an instant. Another idea, would be as the user is scrolling through the page there would be transitions effects going to and from each page.
